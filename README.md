A space invaders game that I'm teaching myself pygame with, and that I'd like to customize extensively:
* levels  (increasing speed, number of enemies, accuracy of enemy bombs...)
* tiers of enemies with different scores
* music and ~~sound effects~~
* explosion sprites
* enemies speeding up as the move closer
* ~~enemies having two states to imitate movement~~
* ~~enemies shooting~~/dropping bombs
* fly-across enemies for bonus points
* ~~player lives~~
* custom enemies that add temporary game features
    * speeding up/slowing down
    * tilting the screen (?)
    * special ammo
    * same-color enemies all drop dead at once
    * multiple player spaceships
    * arkanoid instead of laser shot
 

I'd also like to use this to learn Kivy, and port this to a mobile game.
